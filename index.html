          This paper represents a novel adapative learning strategy. The most accurate classification model from a hetrogenous
          classifer pool is selecte at each learning epach. Our goal is to achiever greater incremental improvement in accuracy, compared
          to using a single type of classification model throughout the process. The strategy is evalulated on benchmark data sets.
          We further consider an application to texture classification problems in sonar mosaic imagery and compare it with non-adaptive
          active learning and traditional machine learning approaches. Our results show that... We conclude that...

          Active Learning (Angluin, 1988, Cohn et al., 1994) is a paradigm where a concept is learnt by an
          intelligent machine through the interaction of an oracle with the machine system, over a sequence of
          learning epochs. A distinctive component in an active system is the querying strategy, used to sample
          candidate training instances from a pool and evaluate them for informativeness, i.e., their potential
          to improve the classification model. Various strategies have been proposed including; Query by
          Committee (Seung et al., 1992), Monte Carlo estimation (Roy and McCallum, 2001), uncertainty
          sampling (Lewis and Gale, 1994) and version space reduction (margin sampling) (Tong and Koller,
          2001). Irrespective of how the most informative pattern instances are chosen at each epoch they are
          presented for labeling, to a machine (database) or human oracle that has knowledge of the class
          labels. After adding the newly labeled instances to the current training set, a revised model is
          subsequently induced. A goal of this process is to achieve an efficient, incremental advancement of
          learning at each epoch. The process is continued until some stopping criterion has been met, such as
          reaching a stage where information from the selected instances is contrary to the model, causing the
          classifier confidence to drop, as in Vlachos (2008).

        The pervasiveness of data collection through wearable devices has led to concerns regarding the security of data and loss of privacy.  Health data is considered the most sensitive category of personal information. Its growing commercial value has led to misuse for purposes such as targeted advertising, unlawful service acquisition and identity theft (Cilliers, 2019, Mone and Shakhlo, 2023). Users may be unaware of the extent of data being collected, stored and shared. This is because privacy policies are lengthy, complex and profuse, that conceal details of data collection and usage. Furthermore, data transmission of wearable devices compromises of wireless or Bluetooth technologies which are prone to modification as hackers can tamper with the content of exchanged data packets or alter the timestamp of them (Cilliers, 2019). The absence of stringent security protocols and encryption for data transmission and storage leaves users vulnerable to cyber-attacks and data breaches. Healthcare breaches "affecting 500 people or more were reported to the US Office for Civil Rights of the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS)", as shown in Figure 2 (note data is incomplete for 2023) (Mone and Shakhlo, 2023)
