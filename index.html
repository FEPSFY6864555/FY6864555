         Atrial fibrillation (AF) is a prevalent cardiac arrhythmia associated with significant health risks. Wearable technologies have revolutionised the 
         detection of AF by enabling continuous monitoring and offering personalised healthcare solutions. However, their integration into healthcare raises
         ethical concerns such as implementations of algorithmic bias in photoplethysmography (PPG) sensors, autonomy and informed consent in empowering patients
         and the compromised data security collected. This essay concludes that inclusivity, transparency in data practices and robust data security measures
         are crucial to ensure the ethical and effective adoption of these technologies in healthcare.

         Wearable technology provides innovative and cost-effective solutions for detecting AF, which is recognised as a global health challenge due to its rising 
         prevalence and life-threatening complications. (Kornej et al., 2020). AF is a type of cardiac arrhythmia that is difficult to detect and often asymptomatic 
         with high risks of ischemic strokes and myocardial infarction (Nemati et al., 2016). Traditionally, electrocardiogram (ECG) monitoring systems are used to 
         detect arrhythmias. The use of this is limited to the duration of the appointment, whereas wearable devices enable continuous monitoring that empowers
         patients and healthcare providers (Duncker et al., 2021). Despite their transformative potential, integrating wearable technology and AI into healthcare
         raises critical ethical concerns. This essay explores the extent of how which algorithmic bias, informed consent, and autonomy in the use of data and
         data security impact the adoption of wearable technology into healthcare.

        The pervasiveness of data collection through wearable devices has led to concerns regarding the security of data and loss of privacy.  Health data is considered the most sensitive category of personal information. Its growing commercial value has led to misuse for purposes such as targeted advertising, unlawful service acquisition and identity theft (Cilliers, 2019, Mone and Shakhlo, 2023). Users may be unaware of the extent of data being collected, stored and shared. This is because privacy policies are lengthy, complex and profuse, that conceal details of data collection and usage. Furthermore, data transmission of wearable devices compromises of wireless or Bluetooth technologies which are prone to modification as hackers can tamper with the content of exchanged data packets or alter the timestamp of them (Cilliers, 2019). The absence of stringent security protocols and encryption for data transmission and storage leaves users vulnerable to cyber-attacks and data breaches. Healthcare breaches "affecting 500 people or more were reported to the US Office for Civil Rights of the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS)", as shown in Figure 2 (note data is incomplete for 2023) (Mone and Shakhlo, 2023)
